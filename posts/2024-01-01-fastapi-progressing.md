Finally, I managed to break the website down into small pieces and implement them to my website using mainly the python libraries FastAPI and Jinja2. With this, another optical makeover is coming. Yet, I am almost sure, that this will change a couple of times.
Good thing is, that the more modularized the project gets, the easier it gets to customize on a global level. This saves time, and since time equals money, this saves money ;)
Greets!

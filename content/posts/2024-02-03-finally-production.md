## A long way behind, a long one to go

So, the thing is, I wrote these lines before 182bit.org went live to production, because apparently on the run, there can be some obstacles in your way. Sailing the ship in development on my local machine, using uvicorn was fast and straight forward.

It is not that the upcoming challenges were overly hard or complex, but my main feedback tool ChatGPT had some issues in generating responses, and I got reminded how dependent of it I still am. One cannot speed up experience, I guess.

Also, there is still no extended markdown functionality implemented, but I guess it is time to focus again an some minor details on the interface and design. I have 'tags' and 'author' metadata in my yaml headers, so I want to show them and present them in an appealing way.

Next biggy might be [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) implementation, yet it might take some time, because project requests start to fly in, so I guess all of this starts working in a way ;)

At this point, what really got me a huge push forward in this was setting up **NVIM** as my proper **IDE** for, well, everything. Among other great tutorials there is an outstanding one for setting up **NVIM** on the YoutTube channel of [@typecraft_dev](https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev), that I would like to recommend anybody, who wants to be a super-cool neckbeard or just doesn't get the tickles using VSCode.

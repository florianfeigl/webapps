Finally! Another break through - at least for my narrow horizon. My domains received ssl certificates via
let's encrypt using dehydrated and I pretty much love the fact as it is.
Also, I managed to create some webpages using bootstrap and also wordpress. Still looking for a way to implement
a posting system though and I don't want to go for a solution using PHP.
Maybe it is finally time to get handy with fastapi or rocket or both. Bootstrap makes it really easy to create
a well organized, well designed frontend, now it is time to give it some life!

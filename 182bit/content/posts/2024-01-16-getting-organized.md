I managed to reorganize some of my backbone structure which should make it more scaleable 
as content grows. I recognized some problems regarding responsibility on smaller displays 
as well but have not found any satisfying solution just yet.

I am trying to implemet markdown parsing on my posts, providing a broader range of possibilities
to design larger texts and more ellaborated journals with the aim of delivering information better.

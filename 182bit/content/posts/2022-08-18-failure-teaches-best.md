So, I managed to mess something up beyond my understanding. More or less out of nowhere problems with ssl certificates came up and I had to start from scratch because I really did not know where to start. So, dehydrated freshly installed, fixed some stuff there, tweaked around in the nginx config files and so on, so forth. Right now the site is reachable via http without any problems, as far as I can see and I had some time to do some reading in the meantime. Therefore, I guess putting this status updates into a database and installing a mail service are the next milestones to go for, if anything else is fixed.

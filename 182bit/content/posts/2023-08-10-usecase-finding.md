Finally, a bit of time to progress some stuff. Meanwhile, I started working with the bootstrap framework and
templates for it and it is really fun. If things go on this well, I can start building a small portfolio with actual usecase.
For now, it is not much and I still have a lot to learn but hey, you've got to celebrate small steps as well.
Stay well!

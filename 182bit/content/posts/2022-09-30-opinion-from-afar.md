Started noticing this project again. Funny how easy it is to come up with small ideas and lose interest at first steps. Purpose seems to be an essential need for drive. Then again it has something magical to write one's articles directly into a html file. Kind of gives the feeling one would have proceeded to develop special skills. It's great!

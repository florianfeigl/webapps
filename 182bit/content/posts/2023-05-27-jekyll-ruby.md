Running into first problems. I want to keep the installation as tidy as possible, which is not the easiest task with the narrow knowledge that I have. I installed ruby with RVM in my sudo-user's $HOME directory. With this, I do not own the right permissions to start jekyll within the project directories (/var/www/TLD).
